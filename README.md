# SpecWav-Attack
A robust adversarial model leveraging spectrogram resizing and Wav2Vec 2.0 for attacking anonymized speech.

---

## 📄 Abstract

SpecWav-Attack focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in anonymized speech systems. The model incorporates:
- **Spectrogram Resizing (SR):** To distort speaker-specific features while retaining content-related information.
- **Wav2Vec 2.0:** For self-supervised feature extraction, generating high-dimensional embeddings to enrich speech representations.
- **Incremental Training:** A two-phase training process to enhance model robustness and avoid overfitting.

Evaluated on **LibriSpeech-dev** and **LibriSpeech-test**, SpecWav-Attack consistently outperforms traditional approaches, revealing significant vulnerabilities in anonymized speech systems.

## 🏗️ Architecture
![alt text](image.png)
The architecture of SpecWav-Attack includes:
1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Vertical resizing of Mel spectrograms to distort speaker features.
2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Utilizing Wav2Vec 2.0 to generate 1024-dimensional embeddings.
3. **Classifier:**
   - A modified ECAPA-TDNN model for speaker identification tasks.
